# Health Care Application with Disease Prediction


## Overview

Developed a mobile health care application with disease prediction. The application leverages machine learning, clean architecture, and state management to diagnose diseases based on user-input symptoms. Additionally, it incorporates Cloud Firestore for data management and features such as medical health records, user profile, and calendar.

## Features

- **Disease Prediction:**
  - Utilizes machine learning for disease prediction based on user-entered symptoms.
  - Implements clean architecture and state management for efficient code organization.


- **Medical Health Record:**
  - Maintains a comprehensive health record for each user, including chronic diseases, genetic diseases, and general diseases.

- **User Profile and Calendar:**
  - Manages user profiles and integrates a calendar feature for scheduling and tracking medical appointments.

## Disease Prediction

The application assists users in diagnosing diseases through a machine learning model that analyzes symptoms provided by the user. This predictive feature enhances the early detection of potential health issues.

## Archive of User Diseases

The archive of user diseases is categorized into three sections:
- Chronic Diseases
- Genetic Diseases
- General Diseases

### Disease Details

Each disease in the archive contains detailed information:
- Symptoms
- Causes
- Treatments
- Prevention measures

Users can access this information to better understand and manage their condition.

### Accessing User Medical History

Uploaded reports and images contribute to a comprehensive medical history. Doctors can access this information through the application, aiding in better diagnosis and treatment decisions.

### Uploading Reports and Images

The application allows users to securely upload reports, X-rays, and other medical images. Data is stored securely for future reference.
